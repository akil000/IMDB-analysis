## Short description
The project involved creating a classifier capable of automatically detecting the sentiment of movie reviews (positive or negative) using the Naive Bayes method. As part of the work, a dataset of movie reviews was prepared, processed, and used to train the classifier based on words and expressions present in the texts. 
The project was completed as part of the "Introduction to data analysis" course.
## Data
The data was retrived from Kaggle. You can find the original [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
